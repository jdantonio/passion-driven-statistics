When examining the association between the presences of classifiable primary morphology (categorical response variable) hemisphere (North or South) in which a crater is located (categorical explanatory variable), a chi-square test of independence revealed that craters in the Northern hemisphere are more likely to have a classifiable primary morphology (12.43%) compared to those in the Southern hemisphere (11.08%), X2 = 163.5012, 1 df, p < 0.0001.
