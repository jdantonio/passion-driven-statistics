<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Mars craters come in all shapes and sizes. They also exhibit a wide array of characteristics. Reason would indicate that the diameter of a crater and its depth would be positively related--bigger craters should be deeper--but little is known about the size of a crater in relationship to its other characteristics. It is possible that other factors, such as distance of a crater from the equator, may be related to its size.</p>
<h2>Research Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li><span>Is crater depth associated with its diameter.</span></li>
<li><span>Is crater diameter associated with its position relative to the equator.</span></li>
<li><span>Is crater depth associated with its position relative to the equator.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<h4>Sample</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>All craters on Mars (378,540) with diameters greater than or equal to 1 km. as compiled by Stuart Robbins.</span></li>
<li><span>Dr. Robbins compiled the Mars global crater database while pursuing his Ph.D. in Geophysics from the University of Colorado.</span></li>
<li><span>The Mars global database was published as part of Dr. Robbins' thesis Planetary "Surface Properties, Cratering Physics, and the Volcanic History of Mars from a New Global Martian Crater Database" in 2011.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Measures</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Crater latitude was calculated from a best-fit derived center and was measured in decimal degrees North.</span></li>
<li><span>Diameter was measured in kilometers from the derived center to the rim vertices.</span></li>
<li><span>Depth was measured in kilometers from the crater rim to the lowest elevation of the crater floor.</span></li>
<li><span>For some calculations craters were separated into groups representing ten-degree "bands" of latitude.</span></li>
<li><span>For some calculation crater latitude was rounded down to the nearest whole degree latitude.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<h4>Univariate</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>The average crater diameter is 3.56 km. (s.d. 8.59)</span></li>
<li><span>The average crater depth is 0.0758 km. (s.d. 0.2215)</span></li>
<li><span>The average crater latitude is 7.20 degrees South (s.d. 3.36) showing a slight skew toward the Southern hemisphere.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Bivariate</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>As expected, analysis showed a positive correlation between crater diameter and depth (corr. 0.58671, p &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that 34.4% of the depth variance can be explained by diameter. That is, bigger craters tend to be deeper craters.</span></li>
<li><span>There is a minimal but significant negative correlation between crater latitude and diameter (corr. -0.05794 p &lt; 0.0001). That is, craters tend to be slightly wider as they get nearer to the equator.</span></li>
<li><span>There is a minimal but significant negative correlation between crater latitude and depth (corr. -0.04288 p &lt; 0.0001). That is, craters tend to be slightly deeper as they get nearer to the equator.</span></li>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h4>What might the results mean?</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>The distance of a crater from the Mars equator seems to have a small but measurable relationship to its diameter and depth.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Strength</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Results are based on a comprehensive and statistically complete study of over 380,000 Mars craters.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Crater diameter and depth had to be calculated based upon a number of factors related to the crater rim. Although mathematically consistent, these values are approximations. The small correlations found in this study could be the result of measuring errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Recommended Future Research</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>Further research is needed to determine whether relationships exist between any other characteristics of Mars craters.</span></li>
