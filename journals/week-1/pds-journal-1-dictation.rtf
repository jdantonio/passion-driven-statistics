\f0\fs24 \cf0 For me like most students in this class I would guess the first week of passion driven statistics was a eye-opening learning process, what little bit with statistics on my free time is mostly in Ruby to the language I program in daily but I haven't done any real applied statistical analysis like this is very excited to do that because I know that there's tremendous value in that but I had no idea what to expect in the course am the first hurdle I ran into was with the data set I chose I chose to use the Mars crater data set but big fan of science fiction and I used to want to be a astronaut when I was a kid so idea of exploring Mars even, this level was pretty exciting so I decided to use the Mars data set and decided to do some initial fermentation Ruby could that was easiest for me while there are 380,000+ records in the Mars data set and that turned out to be its own particular challenge that informs issues with Ruby which I was able to work through by chimps some of my algorithms on a also found that when tackling certain results like frequency values whether I use sass or our or Ruby editing a large number of values him and unreasonable number values take for example the question I decided answer was is there a relationship between the a craters position relative to the equator and its size are craters bigger near the equator than at whole With 380,000 craters in the database every crater has a latitude of its center expressed in degrees and minutes north or south of the equator when performing a frequency tabulation on that the problem you get is that there are couple hundred thousand Valley of values and return because of the accuracy of the measurements what I really didn't need to know the position of every crater that exactly what I really need to know was the hands of craters on where the frequency of craters at 1\'b0 versus 2\'b0 versus 3\'b0 or even larger set such as during Greece zero through nine and 10 through 20 have you additionally I determined that with respect to position on thinking in terms of how close is it to the equator versus the pole then North or South becomes irrelevant a crater that is at 20\'b0 north is equidistant from the pole as a career that is 20 preset justifiable so I decided to in my calculations use the absolute value function against the craters latitude to make North and South irrelevant and then using other mathematical tools with in both sass and are reduced my measurements to basically group craters based upon bands of latitude and when I did that I was able to get data that was much more manageable and that times are making a lot more sense so I used sass because that was what the examples from the charter were given and I felt that was my best bet for getting the data right the first time up ultimately after this class will have access to sex anymore so I used are also which I'm trying to teach myself as we go to is this class on AOC Ruby because I being a Ruby programmer can write that code fairly quickly on site did use are to produce a couple of graphs I used Ruby produce a couple of grass Valley posting all of my graphs to this blog as well}
