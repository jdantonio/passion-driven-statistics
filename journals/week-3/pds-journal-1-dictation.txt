Hi this is Jerry D'Antonio this is my journal entry for week three of passion driven statistics on the deck past week we worked with graphing out exciting for me on the visual learner and so I like having pictures and diagrams and charts and things to look at that deftly helps month with my understanding of different concepts and so I had a lot of fun working with sass and are this week doing the graphing on and publishing things while doing a graphing I learned that the given the 380,000 entries in the Mars crater data set that we try do a scatter plot with sass the least with the version that we're using for the course it will crash and burn horribly never producer scattered pot on I found that when doing the scatter plots with our that worked out extremely well it took a few seconds but is able to produce them staffs not so much I did find that it's*Jimmy well with the bar chart wizard that was a lot of fun being able to select different entries in the wizard and him walk through without having to know much about programming 20 are to do the similar graphs to go extra work I didn't have yet to figure out how to with our graph the two different variables in a bar chart to be giving sesson I'm sure it's possible I'm I just invest them attempt to figure out on the road to assess for me and most interesting important thing of this week was when I was working with the Mars data on that it dawned on me it didn't seem at first as other might be much of correlation with respect my research question that is is the is there a relationship between the size of the crater and its distance from the equator weddings I notice is that with the frequency there see more creators neared the any latitude near the equator than at any degree latitude closer to a poll that makes sense because the surface area of anyone degree band going around a planet will be much greater nearer the equator than your whole ancestry thinking I wonder you Odyssey there should be more craters but wonder if there's some kind of cratered density relationship that perhaps they are others tensor number of the density of craters and any square climate or weather that would be different near the pole eight versus near the equator and the lightbulb went off I understood very clearly with professors talking about freaking the course one of her first lectures the professor had said that exploratory statistics is all about moving forward you explore the data you learn a few things then you explore more you learn more things and so on and that was that really hit home for me at this point because that's when I started thinking how could I go about now determining what the density of the craters would be at any particular point of latitude and realized that's another direction I could take looking at this data and that's what makes it really hit home for me that you as you look today a you discover things make it other things and then you explore the data more and that's when things really clicked for me and I am so is a very important moment for me this week at the same time taking this course I'm also taking another course error course on statistics and that is theAm making sense of data from your shift Ronna and I realized that it's really a good pairing to be taking these two courses at same time hearing this course the passion driven statistics in week we're talking about how we answer this to the question were not spending too much time on the mathematics itself which is fine I think that that provides for a really nice focus in this course the course were focusing on the mathematics and what do the various different calculations mean and digging more into that and so on some concepts for example you central tendency and skewing things are covered both classes with preferred perspective and some finding that this stuff that I learned any other statistics course I can apply the passion driven course provides a nicer outlet for that learning than simply doing the math out of context so I'm really enjoying taking these two classes gather simultaneously on and I will recommend for anybody who's interested and really enjoyed this class but more about the statistics directly in the University front of the class is very good so I'm looking forward next week to action running some more mathematics against this data and seeing if there is a real statistical correlation
